- **Terminal integration** - x-cli embedded in VS Code terminal
- **Context sync** - Open files automatically available to AI
- **Sidebar panel** - Dedicated Grok One-Shot interface
- **Keyboard shortcuts** - Quick access to AI commands
- **File operations** - AI can modify open files directly
- **Git integration** - Commit, PR creation from extension

## Roadmap

### Q2 2025: Sprint 11-12 (4 weeks)

**Priority:** P1 - Major feature for market positioning

## Current Workaround

Use Grok One-Shot CLI in integrated terminal:
```bash
# In VS Code or JetBrains terminal
x-cli

# AI can still modify files
# Refresh editor to see changes
```
