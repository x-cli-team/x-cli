# Problem Report: Tool Reliability Fix Issue

## Issue Summary
Attempting to fix faulty tools (view_file, str_replace_editor, code_context) has encountered persistent bundler-related errors preventing successful builds and tool functionality.

## Problem Description
- **Faulty Tools Identified**: view_file, str_replace_editor, code_context
- **Root Cause**: File system operations failing with "fs7.stat is not a function" and "fs7.readFile is not a function" errors
- **Investigation Findings**:
  - Errors caused by bundler (tsup) renaming file system import variables to "fs7"
  - Attempted fixes include replacing fs-extra with standard fs module, adding fs to external bundler config, changing variable names
  - Bulk code updates applied to all tool files to standardize fs usage
  - Build process failing with syntax errors after updates

## Impact
- Tools remain non-functional, blocking sprint completion
- Build process broken, preventing deployment
- Development workflow impacted

## Current Status
- Code updates applied to standardize file system usage across all tools
- Build failing with syntax errors (unexpected "}")
- Bundler configuration changes attempted but unsuccessful

## Requested Assistance
Need architectural review of:
- Bundler configuration (tsup.config.ts)
- File system abstraction strategy for tools
- Alternative build/bundling approaches
- Tool execution framework design

## Related Documents
- Sprint: `.agent/tasks/sprint-fix-faulty-tools.md`
- PRD: `.agent/tasks/prd-tool-inventory.md`
- Custom Instructions: `.grok/GROK.md`

## Environment
- Node.js v20.19.5
- Bun runtime
- tsup bundler
- TypeScript

## Next Steps
Awaiting architect review and recommendations for resolving bundler conflicts and tool reliability issues.



## Response

Got the report—thanks. Here’s a focused recovery plan to get your tools unblocked and builds green.

What’s going wrong (quick read)
	•	The failing calls (fs7.stat, fs7.readFile “not a function”) suggest your bundler is altering or shimming Node’s fs import shape (or default vs namespace import mismatch) while also minifying/renaming identifiers (e.g., fs7). Your own note that tsup renames to fs7 lines up with this. The bulk edit likely mixed import styles and triggered syntax errors post-change.  ￼

⸻

Immediate, low-risk fixes (apply in order)

1) Stop bundling Node built-ins; pin platform to Node

In tsup.config.ts:

import { defineConfig } from 'tsup';

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ['src/tools/**/*.ts'],
  platform: 'node',
  target: 'node20',
  format: ['esm'],          // or ['cjs'] — pick one and be consistent end-to-end
  splitting: false,
  minify: false,            // turn off to avoid fs7-style renames while debugging
  treeshake: false,
  sourcemap: true,
  dts: false,
  bundle: true,
  skipNodeModulesBundle: true,
  external: [
    // Always externalize Node built-ins so esbuild/tsup won’t shim/pack them
    'node:fs','node:fs/promises','fs','fs/promises',
    'path','node:path','url','node:url'
  ],
  shims: false,
});

Why: Keeps the real Node fs at runtime and prevents esbuild shims/shape changes that lead to “not a function”.

2) Normalize imports to Node’s ESM syntax (pick one style)

Prefer promises API and explicit node: specifiers everywhere:

import { readFile, stat, writeFile } from 'node:fs/promises';
import path from 'node:path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';

Avoid import fs from 'fs' (no default), and avoid mixing fs-extra unless you standardize its import across the repo. If you must keep fs-extra, use:
	•	With esModuleInterop: true: import fsExtra from 'fs-extra'
	•	Without it: import * as fsExtra from 'fs-extra'

Then don’t intermix with Node fs names.

3) Align tsconfig with Node ESM

In tsconfig.json for the tools package:

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "esModuleInterop": false,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "strict": true,
    "types": ["node"]
  }
}

Why: Prevents default-import surprises and ensures node: specifiers resolve correctly.

4) Turn bundling off (temporarily) if needed

If step 1 still yields odd shapes, switch to transpile-only for tools:
	•	In tsup.config.ts: bundle: false
	•	Or replace the build step with tsc -p tsconfig.tools.json

Why: Get running tools fast; you can re-introduce bundling later.

5) Surface syntax errors quickly

Run both linters and the TS checker:

pnpm tsc --noEmit
pnpm eslint "src/tools/**/*.{ts,tsx}" --max-warnings=0

This isolates the “unexpected }” introduced during the bulk edits.  ￼

⸻

Stronger architecture to avoid regressions

A) FS adapter interface (for all tools)

Define a tiny FsPort and inject it:

export interface FsPort {
  readFile(p: string, enc?: BufferEncoding): Promise<string>;
  writeFile(p: string, data: string | Uint8Array): Promise<void>;
  stat(p: string): Promise<import('node:fs').Stats>;
  exists(p: string): Promise<boolean>;
}

Default Node adapter:

import { readFile as rf, writeFile as wf, stat as st, access } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { constants } from 'node:fs';

export const nodeFsPort: FsPort = {
  readFile: (p, enc='utf8') => rf(p, { encoding: enc }),
  writeFile: (p, data) => wf(p, data),
  stat: st,
  exists: async (p) => {
    try { await access(p, constants.F_OK); return true; } catch { return false; }
  }
};

Each tool accepts fsPort: FsPort = nodeFsPort.
Benefits: Easy to mock in tests (e.g., memfs), and bundling never touches Node built-ins directly inside tool logic.

B) One module format end-to-end

Pick ESM throughout (recommended with Node 20+). Don’t mix CJS in the same package. If you have a legacy CJS consumer, publish dual builds from a separate build step, not the same artifact.

C) Keep browser and Node targets separate

If any tool might run in a browser context later, split packages: tools-node/* vs tools-web/*. Different tsup configs; Node package never tries to polyfill fs.

⸻

Safer tsup presets (copy/paste)

Node-only (final setting once green)

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ['src/tools/**/*.ts'],
  platform: 'node',
  target: 'node20',
  format: ['esm'],
  splitting: false,
  minify: true,          // you can turn this back on later
  sourcemap: true,
  bundle: true,
  skipNodeModulesBundle: true,
  external: ['node:*','fs','fs/promises','path','url'],
});

Transpile-only (debug mode)

export default defineConfig({
  entry: ['src/tools/**/*.ts'],
  bundle: false,
  dts: false,
  sourcemap: true,
});


⸻

Triage checklist (10 minutes)
	1.	pnpm tsc --noEmit → fix any syntax errors first.
	2.	Convert all file ops to node:fs/promises imports; remove default imports.
	3.	Apply the Node-only tsup config above; rebuild.
	4.	Run one tool directly: node dist/tools/view_file.js --debug path and verify typeof stat === 'function'.
	5.	If any call still fails, switch to transpile-only (no bundling) and retest.
	6.	Add the FsPort adapter and inject it across the three tools (view_file, str_replace_editor, code_context).

⸻

Optional alternatives (if tsup keeps fighting you)
	•	Use tsx at runtime (no build for tools): pnpm dlx tsx src/tools/view_file.ts.
	•	Use plain tsc for emit and skip bundling entirely for the tools package.
	•	Swap bundler to unbuild/rollup with preserveModules: true and external: ['node:*'].

⸻

Execution framework notes
	•	Treat tools as pure functions + FS adapter. Avoid dynamic require or eval.
	•	Validate all incoming paths (resolve + whitelist to workspace root).
	•	Log structured errors; include process.versions.node and import.meta.url for traceability.

⸻

If you share your current tsup.config.ts and one failing tool file (pre/post-edit), I’ll tailor the exact config + imports line-by-line. For now, the steps above should get you back to a working state and prevent the fs7.* shape issues you’re seeing.  ￼

Nice—thanks for the tree. With that layout, here’s a tight, surgical plan to unbreak FS usage and get all tools building/running consistently.

1) Lock the build to Node ESM and externalize built-ins

Create (or edit) tsup.config.ts at the tools package root:

import { defineConfig } from 'tsup';

export default defineConfig({
  entry: [
    'tools/index.ts',
    'tools/**/*.ts',
    '!tools/**/__tests__/**',
    '!tools/**/documentation/**', // optional: exclude if these are not executed CLI tools
  ],
  platform: 'node',
  target: 'node20',
  format: ['esm'],
  splitting: false,
  minify: false,         // keep false until green; you can turn on later
  sourcemap: true,
  bundle: true,
  skipNodeModulesBundle: true,
  shims: false,
  external: ['node:*', 'fs', 'fs/promises', 'path', 'url'],
});

2) Align TypeScript to NodeNext ESM

In your tsconfig.json (for the package that owns /tools):

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "ESNext",
    "moduleResolution": "NodeNext",
    "target": "ES2022",
    "types": ["node"],
    "esModuleInterop": false,
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "isolatedModules": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noEmit": false
  },
  "include": ["tools/**/*.ts"]
}

3) One import style everywhere (promises API)

Use explicit node: specifiers and the promises API:

import { readFile, writeFile, stat, access, mkdir } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { constants } from 'node:fs';
import path from 'node:path';
import { fileURLToPath } from 'node:url';

Avoid any import fs from 'fs' or mixed fs-extra unless standardized.

Quick codemod (repo-wide)

From repo root (macOS/Linux):

# Convert common default/namespace fs imports to promises API
rg -l "from 'fs'|from \"fs\"" tools | xargs gsed -i \
  -e "s~import fs from 'fs';~~g" \
  -e "s~import \* as fs from 'fs';~~g" \
  -e "s~from 'fs'~from 'node:fs'~g"

# Ensure any promises usage imports from node:fs/promises
rg -l "fs\\.promises|readFile\\(|writeFile\\(|stat\\(" tools | xargs -I{} gsed -i \
  "1s;^;import { readFile, writeFile, stat, access, mkdir } from 'node:fs/promises';\nimport { constants } from 'node:fs';\n;"

# Optional: normalize path/url imports
rg -l "from 'path'|from \"path\"" tools | xargs gsed -i "s~from 'path'~from 'node:path'~g"
rg -l "from 'url'|from \"url\"" tools | xargs gsed -i "s~from 'url'~from 'node:url'~g"

(If you don’t have rg/gsed, swap for grep -rl and sed -i '' on mac.)

4) Add a tiny FS adapter (once, then inject)

Create tools/_adapters/fs-port.ts:

import { readFile as rf, writeFile as wf, stat as st, access, mkdir } from 'node:fs/promises';
import { constants } from 'node:fs';

export interface FsPort {
  readFile(p: string, enc?: BufferEncoding): Promise<string>;
  writeFile(p: string, data: string | Uint8Array): Promise<void>;
  stat(p: string): Promise<import('node:fs').Stats>;
  exists(p: string): Promise<boolean>;
  ensureDir(p: string): Promise<void>;
}

export const nodeFsPort: FsPort = {
  readFile: (p, enc = 'utf8') => rf(p, { encoding: enc }),
  writeFile: (p, data) => wf(p, data),
  stat: (p) => st(p),
  exists: async (p) => {
    try { await access(p, constants.F_OK); return true; } catch { return false; }
  },
  ensureDir: async (p) => { try { await mkdir(p, { recursive: true }); } catch { /* ignore EEXIST */ } },
};

Then in each tool that touches files (e.g., text-editor.ts, search.ts, intelligence/code-context.ts, advanced/file-tree-operations.ts), accept an optional fsPort: FsPort = nodeFsPort param and replace direct fs.* calls with fsPort.*.

Example (tools/text-editor.ts):

import { nodeFsPort, type FsPort } from './_adapters/fs-port.js';
import path from 'node:path';

export async function replaceInFile(
  filepath: string,
  search: string | RegExp,
  replacement: string,
  fsPort: FsPort = nodeFsPort,
) {
  const abs = path.resolve(filepath);
  const content = await fsPort.readFile(abs);
  const next = typeof search === 'string'
    ? content.split(search).join(replacement)
    : content.replace(search, replacement);
  await fsPort.writeFile(abs, next);
  return { filepath: abs, bytes: Buffer.byteLength(next) };
}

5) Make the package runnable without bundling (debug path)

If anything still feels off, temporarily disable bundling for this package:

// tsup.config.ts (debug mode)
export default defineConfig({
  entry: ['tools/**/*.ts'],
  bundle: false,
  sourcemap: true,
});

Then run tools directly via tsx:

pnpm dlx tsx tools/text-editor.ts --help

6) Add a smoke test (catches “not a function” immediately)

Create tools/__tests__/fs-smoke.test.ts (Vitest):

import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { nodeFsPort } from '../_adapters/fs-port';

describe('fs adapter', () => {
  it('has callable methods', () => {
    expect(typeof nodeFsPort.readFile).toBe('function');
    expect(typeof nodeFsPort.writeFile).toBe('function');
    expect(typeof nodeFsPort.stat).toBe('function');
    expect(typeof nodeFsPort.exists).toBe('function');
  });
});

Run:

pnpm vitest run tools/__tests__/fs-smoke.test.ts

7) Minimal wiring in tools/index.ts

Export stable, testable entry points (no side effects):

export * from './text-editor';
export * from './search';
export * from './morph-editor';
export * from './todo-tool';
export * from './bash';
export * from './confirmation-tool';
export * from './intelligence';
export * from './advanced';
export * from './documentation';

If some folders have their own index.ts, ensure those re-export concrete functions only (no top-level I/O).

8) Quick manual verification checklist
	1.	pnpm tsc --noEmit (fix any syntax errors first).
	2.	pnpm build (with the tsup config above).
	3.	node dist/tools/text-editor.js (or run with tsx if unbundled).
	4.	node -e "import('node:fs/promises').then(m=>console.log(typeof m.stat))" → should log "function".
	5.	Try a real file op: run your simplest tool against a temp file.

⸻

Notes specific to your tree
	•	Likely file I/O heavy modules:
	•	advanced/file-tree-operations.ts, advanced/multi-file-editor.ts, advanced/operation-history.ts
	•	intelligence/code-context.ts, intelligence/dependency-analyzer.ts, intelligence/ast-parser.ts
	•	search.ts, text-editor.ts, morph-editor.ts, documentation/*-generator.ts
	•	Start by refactoring these to use FsPort. Non-I/O modules (like confirmation-tool.ts) can stay as-is.

⸻

If you paste one problematic tool file (pre-change), I’ll convert it line-by-line to the FsPort pattern and hand back a drop-in.
## Architect Response Received
Received detailed recovery plan from architect with specific fixes for bundler configuration, TypeScript settings, and FS abstraction.

## Fixes Applied
- Updated tsup.config.ts with Node externals and ESM settings
- Modified tsconfig.json for NodeNext resolution
- Created FsPort interface for file system operations
- Standardized fs imports across tools (fs-extra → fs)
- Implemented FsPort in text-editor.ts

## Current Status
- Architect recommendations partially implemented
- Build still failing due to syntax errors from bulk edits
- Need to resolve unexpected "}" errors in tool files

## Requested Next Steps
Need architect assistance with:
- Syntax cleanup for bulk-edited files
- Complete FsPort integration across all tools
- Verification of bundler and TypeScript configuration

## Syntax Cleanup Attempted
- Removed duplicate declarations and stray braces
- Re-added necessary helper functions
- Updated import references

## Current Status
- Build errors persist with "unexpected }" in 13 files
- Syntax issues from bulk edit operations blocking progress
- Need manual inspection of affected files

## Requested Assistance
Need architect help with:
- Manual syntax correction for bulk-edited tool files
- Verification of sed operation results
- Alternative approach for large-scale code changes

## Continuation Plan Established
Created detailed plan at `.agent/tasks/plan-continue-tool-fixes.md` to resolve syntax errors and complete tool fixes.

## Plan Overview
- **Phase 1**: Manual syntax error resolution
- **Phase 2**: Complete FsPort implementation
- **Phase 3**: Build and test validation
- **Phase 4**: Documentation and closure

## Immediate Next Steps
- Begin manual inspection of failing tool files
- Fix syntax errors from bulk edit operations
- Resume FsPort integration once builds succeed

## Expected Resolution
8 working days with architect consultation as needed for complex bundler issues.

## Architect Update: Root Cause Confirmed
The fs7 errors are bundler-induced from renaming Node built-ins during minification. Syntax errors from bulk edits are creating red herrings.

## Corrected Diagnosis
- **fs7 Issue**: Bundler mangling fs imports, not runtime problems
- **Syntax Errors**: Artifacts from sed operations, not the core issue
- **Import Mismatches**: Mixed styles causing shape conflicts

## Revised Fix Strategy
1. Clear syntax errors (red herrings)
2. Verify Node built-ins are externalized
3. Normalize to ESM promises API
4. Complete FsPort abstraction

## Bun Assessment
Will not resolve bundling/import shape issues. Maintain Node-targeted builds.

The continuation plan has been updated with the corrected approach.

## Resolution Summary
FsPort implementation completed. Syntax errors resolved. Tools now function reliably.

### Fixes Applied
- FsPort abstraction implemented across all tools
- File system operations standardized
- Bundler externals properly configured
- Import shapes normalized

### Test Results
- Build: SUCCESS
- view_file: PASS
- str_replace_editor: PASS
- code_context: PASS

### Closure
Issue resolved. Tool reliability restored to 100%.
