## 🔄 Recent Updates (November 2025)
- **⭐ NEW: Adaptive Terminal Color System**: Revolutionary terminal theme detection that automatically adapts text colors for optimal visibility across all terminal environments. Includes multiple manual override options via environment variables.
- **⭐ NEW: /safe-push Command**: Stable automated git workflow with 5-step quality checks (TypeScript, ESLint, git operations) integrated directly into CLI with real-time feedback. Replaces crash-prone smart-push.
- **🎨 Universal Text Visibility**: Fixed white text invisibility on light terminals by implementing adaptive color detection using COLORFGBG, TERM_BACKGROUND, and TERM_PROGRAM environment variables.
- **🛡️ CLI Stability Improvements**: Eliminated smart-push crashes by creating simplified workflow that doesn't overwhelm the CLI interface with complex shell operations.
- **🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Response Truncation Bug Resolved**: Fixed streaming system bug causing AI responses to cut off mid-sentence. Root cause was throttling logic preventing final content chunks from being processed. Solution: Added force parameter to bypass throttling on stream completion. Impact: 100% response completeness achieved.
- **📚 Streaming Architecture Documentation**: Added comprehensive technical documentation in `.agent/technical/streaming-architecture.md` with critical maintenance guidelines
- **Package Manager Migration**: Switched to Bun for development (npm for distribution)
- **Tooling Optimization**: 4x faster installs, improved TypeScript compilation
- **Lint System Overhaul**: Fixed parsing errors, streamlined configuration
- **Development Workflow**: New SOP for Bun-optimized development process

## Overview
This directory contains AI agent documentation for X-CLI. This system helps AI agents understand the project context efficiently without scanning the entire codebase.

### 🎯 Recent Features
- **Custom Assistant Name**: Users can set a custom name for the AI assistant via `grok set-name <name>`, stored globally in user settings
- **Persistent Confirmation System**: File operations and bash commands require user confirmation by default, with `grok toggle-confirmations` to enable/disable

## 🚀 New: "Research → Recommend → Execute → Auto-Doc" Workflow

X-CLI now features a complete workflow that transforms complex tasks into structured, operator-in-the-loop experiences:

### **Phase 1: Research** 🤔
- AI analyzes your task using intelligent context loading
- Loads system docs, SOPs, and recent task history
- Generates structured Issues/Options/Recommendation/Plan output

### **Phase 2: Recommend** 💡
- Presents clear decision framework with trade-offs
- Shows multiple options with effort/risk analysis
- Recommends optimal approach with confidence scoring

### **Phase 3: Execute** ⚡
- Sequential TODO execution with real-time progress
- Automatic diff display and patch generation
- Safety features: backups, git commits, error recovery
- Adaptive recovery when execution fails

### **Phase 4: Auto-Doc** 📝
- Automatic completion documentation in `.agent/tasks/`
- Lesson learning and SOP candidate detection
- Complete audit trail with metadata and outcomes

### Usage
```bash
# Interactive workflow (recommended)
xcli "implement user authentication system"

# Headless mode for CI
xcli --headless "add logging to API endpoints"

# Non-interactive fallback
xcli --noninteractive "old behavior"
```

### Benefits
- **Safety First**: All changes have patches and backups
- **Resilient**: Adaptive recovery from execution failures
- **Documented**: Automatic knowledge accumulation
- **Efficient**: "One-confirm" decision points, then hands-free execution
- **Contextual**: AI learns from project history and patterns

## 🚨 Critical Configuration Warnings

**🤖 AUTOMATED RELEASE SYSTEM IS NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL (2025-10-17)**

**DO NOT MODIFY THESE SETTINGS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING:**

### 🔒 Protected NPM Publishing Settings
- **`package.json` name**: Must remain `"@xagent/x-cli"` (scoped). Changing this will break NPM publishing unless you have token access for that scope.
- **`package.json` publishConfig**: Must not include `"registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com/"`. Publishing should go to npmjs.com, not GitHub Packages.
- **NPM_TOKEN secret**: Must be a valid automation token from the NPM account owning `@xagent/x-cli`.

### 🔒 Protected Automation Workflow  
- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**: Combined workflow handling version bump + NPM publish
- **`.husky/pre-commit`**: Git hook for version synchronization
- **`scripts/check-version.cjs`**: Automated version bumping and README updates
- **GitHub Secrets**: `PAT_TOKEN` (git operations) + `NPM_TOKEN` (NPM publishing)

### 🔒 Protected Git Operations
- **Git Hooks**: Do not re-enable interactive pre-push hooks, as they block CI/CD pushes.
- **Branch Protection**: Do not prevent GitHub Actions from pushing to main branch.

**Why?** Previous changes to these broke the entire publishing flow. The current system took multiple iterations to get working.

**📚 Full Protection Details**: See `sop/automation-protection.md`

## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### For AI Agents
1. **Always read README.md first** - Get project overview (this file)
2. **Check system/critical-state.md** - Understand current architecture
3. **Review relevant tasks/** - Check for related work or conflicts
4. **Follow sop/** patterns - Use established conventions
5. **Check guardrails/** - Avoid known failure patterns

### For Updates
- Run `/update-agent-docs` after significant changes
- Add new PRDs to tasks/ before implementation
- Update system docs when architecture changes
- Document new patterns in sop/
