# Hotfix Sprint: Stop Repaint Storm & CPU Spikes

## Immediate Triage (No Code Changes)

Run your local CLI with these guardrails to calm the UI while you work:

1. **Force compact + quiet logs**
   - Prefer the run that uses tsx (your dev runner).
   - Start with: `COMPACT=1 DEBUG=0 GROK_MAX_CONCURRENCY=2 GROK_RATE_MIN_MS=500 npm run dev:node`
   - If you have a "trace"/verbose flag anywhere, turn it off.

2. **Kill duplicate runners**
   - Ensure only one process is rendering: `type -a grok` should be "not found" during dev.

3. **Simplify the TTY**
   - Resize the terminal to a normal width (≈100 cols). Extremely wide terminals increase Ink diff work.
   - Avoid streaming two sessions side-by-side in the same window.

If CPU drops under ~30–40% with those, you've confirmed the issue is the render/emit loop, not a rogue tool.

## Hotfix Sprint (Re-apply the Known Good Guardrails)

**Goal:** Cap re-render frequency, quiet the log churn, and keep tool concurrency low.  
**Owner:** CLI/UI  
**ETA:** 1–2 short commits

### Tasks
1. **Render Throttle**
   - Batch UI updates to ~150 ms (≈6–7 FPS). Streaming tokens should append to a buffer and flush on interval/final.

2. **Spinner Snapshot**
   - Replace live spinners with: start → optional periodic single-line → final snapshot only.

3. **Quiet Default Logs**
   - Put per-token logs, [CPU-LOG], queue depth, and console.time traces behind DEBUG=1.

4. **Concurrency & Pacing**
   - Cap concurrent tool executions to 2.
   - Enforce a ≥500 ms inter-request spacing (burst budget OK for short spikes).

5. **Unsubscribe on Exit**
   - Ensure all intervals, timers, and Ink subscriptions are cleared on teardown.

### Acceptance Criteria
- 5-minute streaming test: no flicker, CPU avg <10% on your Mac.
- 15+ tool calls: active tools ≤2, no duplicate console.time warnings.
- Idle at prompt: CPU <3%.

## Verify the Fix (Simple Checks)
- While running, do:
- **Render Cadence:** You should see updates ~6–7 times/second, not every token.
- **Top/Activity Monitor:** Process stays <10–15% during streaming, drops near 0% when idle.
- **Logs:** No per-token spam unless DEBUG=1.

## Common Gotchas That Cause the Spike (Watch for These)
- Re-introduced per-token setState in chat history.
- Accidental double-subscription (effect runs without a cleanup).
- Tool orchestration firing 3+ concurrent operations.

## If You Still See ~136% After This
- Temporarily run in headless/non-UI mode (same runtime) to confirm CPU normalizes; if headless is calm, the hotspot is 100% UI.
- Capture one brief CPU sample (30–60s) and check:
  - % time in your render function(s)
  - timer/interval handlers firing too frequently
  - repeated writes to stdout per token
