# ðŸ“‹ Example PRD: Documentation System Enhancement

## Objective
Add comprehensive documentation generation capabilities to Grok CLI.

## Background
Grok CLI needs better documentation tools to help users document both the CLI itself and their projects efficiently.

## Requirements

### Must Have
- [ ] `/init-agent` command for .agent system creation
- [ ] `/docs` interactive menu for documentation options
- [ ] `/readme` command for README generation
- [ ] Integration with existing command system

### Should Have  
- [ ] `/api-docs` for API documentation
- [ ] `/comments` for code comment generation
- [ ] Auto-update system for documentation maintenance

### Could Have
- [ ] Custom templates for different project types
- [ ] Documentation quality scoring
- [ ] Integration with external documentation tools

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Impact
- New tool directory: `src/tools/documentation/`
- Command integration: Update `use-input-handler.ts`
- New dependencies: Minimal (leverage existing tools)

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Phase 1**: Agent system generator tool
2. **Phase 2**: Core documentation commands
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features and automation

### Compatibility
- Must not break existing functionality
- Should follow established command patterns
- Integrate with current tool system architecture

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can run `/init-agent` and get functional documentation
- [ ] Commands are discoverable and intuitive
- [ ] Generated documentation is high quality
- [ ] System integrates seamlessly with existing workflow

## Dependencies
- Existing AST parser tool
- Current search functionality  
- File operation tools
- Command system in input handler

## Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Command system complexity
- **Mitigation**: Follow existing patterns, minimal changes

## Timeline
- **Week 1-2**: Foundation and agent system
- **Week 3-4**: Core documentation commands
- **Week 5-6**: Advanced features and polish
