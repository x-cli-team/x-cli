# 📚 .agent Documentation System

## Overview

This directory contains AI agent documentation for Grok One-Shot. This system helps AI agents understand the project context efficiently without scanning the entire codebase.

## 🚨 Critical Configuration Warnings

**🤖 AUTOMATED RELEASE SYSTEM IS NOW FULLY OPERATIONAL (2025-10-17)**

**DO NOT MODIFY THESE SETTINGS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING:**

### 🔒 Protected NPM Publishing Settings

- **`package.json` name**: Must remain `"@xagent/one-shot"` (scoped). The legacy `@xagent/x-cli` package is maintained for backwards compatibility.
- **`package.json` publishConfig**: Must not include `"registry": "https://npm.pkg.github.com/"`. Publishing should go to npmjs.com, not GitHub Packages.
- **NPM_TOKEN secret**: Must be a valid automation token from the NPM account owning `@xagent/x-cli`.

### 🔒 Protected Automation Workflow

- **`.github/workflows/release.yml`**: Combined workflow handling version bump + NPM publish
- **`.husky/pre-commit`**: Git hook for version synchronization
- **`scripts/check-version.cjs`**: Automated version bumping and README updates
- **GitHub Secrets**: `PAT_TOKEN` (git operations) + `NPM_TOKEN` (NPM publishing)

### 🔒 Protected Git Operations

- **Git Hooks**: Do not re-enable interactive pre-push hooks, as they block CI/CD pushes.
- **Branch Protection**: Do not prevent GitHub Actions from pushing to main branch.

**Why?** Previous changes to these broke the entire publishing flow. The current system took multiple iterations to get working.

**📚 Full Protection Details**: See `sop/automation-protection.md`

## 📁 Directory Structure

### 📋 system/

Core project information and architecture:

- **architecture.md** - Project structure and design patterns
- **api-schema.md** - API endpoints and data schemas
- **critical-state.md** - Current system state snapshot
- **installation.md** - Installation and setup guide

### 📝 tasks/

Product requirement documents and feature specifications:

- Store PRDs before implementation
- Reference related architecture and dependencies
- Track implementation progress

### 📖 sop/

Standard operating procedures and workflows:

- Development patterns and conventions
- Deployment and maintenance procedures
- Code review and testing guidelines

### 🚨 incidents/

Documented failures with root cause analysis:

- Error patterns and their fixes
- Recovery procedures
- Prevention strategies

### 🛡️ guardrails/

Enforceable rules to prevent recurring mistakes:

- Naming conventions
- Configuration constraints
- Implementation patterns

### ⚙️ commands/

Documentation for documentation system commands:

- Usage guides for /init-agent, /update-agent-docs, etc.
- Integration workflows

## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### For AI Agents

1. **Always read README.md first** - Get project overview (this file)
2. **Check system/critical-state.md** - Understand current architecture
3. **Review relevant tasks/** - Check for related work or conflicts
4. **Follow sop/** patterns - Use established conventions
5. **Check guardrails/** - Avoid known failure patterns

### For Updates

- Run `/update-agent-docs` after significant changes
- Add new PRDs to tasks/ before implementation
- Update system docs when architecture changes
- Document new patterns in sop/
