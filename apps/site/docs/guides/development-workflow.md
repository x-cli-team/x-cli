# Development Workflow Guide

## Package Manager Migration (2025-11-02)

### Overview

The project has migrated from npm to Bun for development workflows while maintaining npm compatibility for distribution and CI/CD.

### Why Bun?

- **Speed**: 4.17s install vs previous npm times
- **TypeScript Native**: Better TS support out of the box
- **Smaller Lock Files**: bun.lock (147KB) vs package-lock.json (297KB)
- **Modern Tooling**: Optimized for CLI tools and modern JS/TS projects

## Development Commands

### Package Management

```bash
# Install dependencies (development)
bun install

# Add new dependency
bun add package-name

# Add dev dependency
bun add -d package-name

# Remove dependency
bun remove package-name
```

### Build & Testing

```bash
# Development build (fast)
bun run build

# Development with watch
bun run dev

# Linting (with auto-fix)
bun run lint
bun run lint --fix

# Type checking
bun run typecheck # if available
```

### File Management

- **Keep**: `bun.lock` (commit this)
- **Ignore**: `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock` (in .gitignore)
- **Clean**: Remove old `node_modules` and reinstall with `bun install`

## CI/CD Strategy

### Development vs Production

- **Local Development**: Use Bun for speed and efficiency
- **GitHub Actions**: Continue using npm for stability and ecosystem compatibility
- **Publishing**: npm for universal package manager support

### Workflow Files

No changes required to GitHub Actions workflows - they continue using npm:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
run: |
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues After Migration

1. **Import/Export Errors**: Ensure all imports use proper file extensions (.js for compiled output)
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Run `bun install` after pulling changes
3. **Build Failures**: Clear `node_modules` and reinstall with Bun

### Lint Error Resolution

Recent fixes addressed:

- Invalid character parsing errors in TypeScript files
- Missing service imports (research-recommend.ts)
- Build configuration compatibility

### Performance Benefits

- **Install Speed**: ~4x faster than npm
- **Build Speed**: Improved TypeScript compilation
- **Development Loop**: Faster iteration cycles

## Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. Use `bun install` for dependencies
2. Use `bun run <script>` for all commands
3. Commit `bun.lock` changes
4. Never commit `package-lock.json`

### For Maintainers

1. Test locally with Bun before pushing
2. Verify GitHub Actions still work (uses npm)
3. Monitor package distribution compatibility
4. Keep both ecosystems working

## Migration Validation

### Checklist

- [x] Dependencies installed with Bun successfully
- [x] Build process works with `bun run build`
- [x] Linting passes with `bun run lint`
- [x] .gitignore updated for package manager files
- [x] Documentation updated
- [x] CI/CD pipeline still functional

### Performance Metrics

- **Before**: npm install (variable, often >30s)
- **After**: bun install (4.17s)
- **node_modules**: Consistent at 267MB (optimized by Bun)
- **Build time**: Improved TypeScript compilation speed

## Future Considerations

### Potential Enhancements

- Explore Bun's built-in bundler as alternative to tsup
- Consider Bun's test runner for future test suites
- Evaluate Bun for CI/CD once ecosystem matures

### Monitoring

- Track installation success rates across different environments
- Monitor CI/CD stability with npm workflow
- Gather developer feedback on Bun experience
