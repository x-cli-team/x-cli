**Planned:** Q3-Q4 2026 (Sprint 23-26)
**Priority:** P2 - Platform extensibility

**What Plugins Enable (in Claude Code):**

* **Custom slash commands**: Create reusable prompt templates
* **Specialized agents**: Bundle pre-configured AI agents for specific tasks
* **Hooks**: Automate workflows with lifecycle event handlers
* **Skills**: Package domain expertise into discoverable capabilities
* **MCP servers**: Include external tool integrations
* **Team distribution**: Share plugins via Git repositories or marketplaces
* **Versioning**: Semantic versioning for plugin releases
* **Dependency management**: Plugins can depend on other plugins

---

Plugins let you extend Grok One-Shot with custom functionality that can be shared across projects and teams. Install plugins from [marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces) to add pre-built commands, agents, hooks, Skills, and MCP servers, or create your own to automate your workflows.

## Quickstart

Let's create a simple greeting plugin to get you familiar with the plugin system. We'll build a working plugin that adds a custom command, test it locally, and understand the core concepts.

### Prerequisites

* Grok One-Shot installed on your machine
* Basic familiarity with command-line tools

### Create your first plugin

<Steps>
<Step title="Create the marketplace structure">
```bash theme={null}
mkdir test-marketplace
cd test-marketplace
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create the plugin directory">
```bash theme={null}
mkdir my-first-plugin
cd my-first-plugin
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create the plugin manifest">
```bash Create .grok-plugin/plugin.json theme={null}
mkdir .grok-plugin
cat > .grok-plugin/plugin.json << 'EOF'
{
"name": "my-first-plugin",
"description": "A simple greeting plugin to learn the basics",
"version": "1.0.0",
"author": {
"name": "Your Name"
}
}
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step title="Add a custom command">
```bash Create commands/hello.md theme={null}
mkdir commands
cat > commands/hello.md << 'EOF'
---
description: Greet the user with a personalized message
---

# Hello Command

Greet the user warmly and ask how you can help them today. Make the greeting personal and encouraging.
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create the marketplace manifest">
```bash Create marketplace.json theme={null}
cd ..
mkdir .grok-plugin
cat > .grok-plugin/marketplace.json << 'EOF'
{
"name": "test-marketplace",
"owner": {
"name": "Test User"
},
"plugins": [
{
"name": "my-first-plugin",
"source": "./my-first-plugin",
"description": "My first test plugin"
}
]
}
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step title="Install and test your plugin">
```bash Start Grok One-Shot from parent directory theme={null}
cd ..
grok
```

```shell Add the test marketplace theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add ./test-marketplace
```

```shell Install your plugin theme={null}
/plugin install my-first-plugin@test-marketplace
```

Select "Install now". You'll then need to restart Grok One-Shot in order to use the new plugin.

```shell Try your new command theme={null}
/hello
```

You'll see Grok use your greeting command! Check `/help` to see your new command listed.
</Step>
</Steps>

You've successfully created and tested a plugin with these key components:

* **Plugin manifest** (`.grok-plugin/plugin.json`) - Describes your plugin's metadata
* **Commands directory** (`commands/`) - Contains your custom slash commands
* **Test marketplace** - Allows you to test your plugin locally

### Plugin structure overview

Your plugin follows this basic structure:

```
my-first-plugin/
├── .grok-plugin/
│ └── plugin.json # Plugin metadata
├── commands/ # Custom slash commands (optional)
│ └── hello.md
├── agents/ # Custom agents (optional)
│ └── helper.md
├── skills/ # Agent Skills (optional)
│ └── my-skill/
│ └── SKILL.md
└── hooks/ # Event handlers (optional)
└── hooks.json
```

**Additional components you can add:**

* **Commands**: Create markdown files in `commands/` directory
* **Agents**: Create agent definitions in `agents/` directory
* **Skills**: Create `SKILL.md` files in `skills/` directory
* **Hooks**: Create `hooks/hooks.json` for event handling
* **MCP servers**: Create `.mcp.json` for external tool integration

<Note>
**Next steps**: Ready to add more features? Jump to [Develop more complex plugins](#develop-more-complex-plugins) to add agents, hooks, and MCP servers. For complete technical specifications of all plugin components, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).

## Install and manage plugins

Learn how to discover, install, and manage plugins to extend your Grok One-Shot capabilities.

### Prerequisites

* Grok One-Shot installed and running
* Basic familiarity with command-line interfaces

### Add marketplaces

Marketplaces are catalogs of available plugins. Add them to discover and install plugins:

```shell Add a marketplace theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add your-org/grok-plugins
```

```shell Browse available plugins theme={null}
/plugin
```

For detailed marketplace management including Git repositories, local development, and team distribution, see [Plugin marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces).

### Install plugins

#### Via interactive menu (recommended for discovery)

```shell Open the plugin management interface theme={null}
/plugin
```

Select "Browse Plugins" to see available options with descriptions, features, and installation options.

#### Via direct commands (for quick installation)

```shell Install a specific plugin theme={null}
/plugin install formatter@your-org
```

```shell Enable a disabled plugin theme={null}
/plugin enable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

```shell Disable without uninstalling theme={null}
/plugin disable plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

```shell Completely remove a plugin theme={null}
/plugin uninstall plugin-name@marketplace-name
```

### Verify installation

After installing a plugin:

1. **Check available commands**: Run `/help` to see new commands
2. **Test plugin features**: Try the plugin's commands and features
3. **Review plugin details**: Use `/plugin` → "Manage Plugins" to see what the plugin provides

## Set up team plugin workflows

Configure plugins at the repository level to ensure consistent tooling across your team. When team members trust your repository folder, Grok One-Shot automatically installs specified marketplaces and plugins.

**To set up team plugins:**

1. Add marketplace and plugin configuration to your repository's `.grok/settings.json`
2. Team members trust the repository folder
3. Plugins install automatically for all team members

For complete instructions including configuration examples, marketplace setup, and rollout best practices, see [Configure team marketplaces](/en/plugin-marketplaces#how-to-configure-team-marketplaces).

***

## Develop more complex plugins

Once you're comfortable with basic plugins, you can create more sophisticated extensions.

### Add Skills to your plugin

Plugins can include [Agent Skills](/en/skills) to extend Grok's capabilities. Skills are model-invoked—Grok autonomously uses them based on the task context.

To add Skills to your plugin, create a `skills/` directory at your plugin root and add Skill folders with `SKILL.md` files. Plugin Skills are automatically available when the plugin is installed.

For complete Skill authoring guidance, see [Agent Skills](/en/skills).

> **Note:** Skills are not yet implemented in Grok One-Shot. See [Skills](../getting-started/skills.md) for details.

### Organize complex plugins

For plugins with many components, organize your directory structure by functionality. For complete directory layouts and organization patterns, see [Plugin directory structure](/en/plugins-reference#plugin-directory-structure).

### Test your plugins locally

When developing plugins, use a local marketplace to test changes iteratively. This workflow builds on the quickstart pattern and works for plugins of any complexity.

<Steps>
<Step title="Set up your development structure">
Organize your plugin and marketplace for testing:

```bash Create directory structure theme={null}
mkdir dev-marketplace
cd dev-marketplace
mkdir my-plugin
```

This creates:

```
dev-marketplace/
├── .grok-plugin/marketplace.json (you'll create this)
└── my-plugin/ (your plugin under development)
├── .grok-plugin/plugin.json
├── commands/
├── agents/
└── hooks/
```
</Step>

<Step title="Create the marketplace manifest">
```bash Create marketplace.json theme={null}
mkdir .grok-plugin
cat > .grok-plugin/marketplace.json << 'EOF'
{
"name": "dev-marketplace",
"owner": {
"name": "Developer"
},
"plugins": [
{
"name": "my-plugin",
"source": "./my-plugin",
"description": "Plugin under development"
}
]
}
EOF
```
</Step>

<Step title="Install and test">
```bash Start Grok One-Shot from parent directory theme={null}
cd ..
grok
```

```shell Add your development marketplace theme={null}
/plugin marketplace add ./dev-marketplace
```

```shell Install your plugin theme={null}
/plugin install my-plugin@dev-marketplace
```

Test your plugin components:

* Try your commands with `/command-name`
* Check that agents appear in `/agents`
* Verify hooks work as expected
</Step>

<Step title="Iterate on your plugin">
After making changes to your plugin code:

```shell Uninstall the current version theme={null}
/plugin uninstall my-plugin@dev-marketplace
```

```shell Reinstall to test changes theme={null}
/plugin install my-plugin@dev-marketplace
```

Repeat this cycle as you develop and refine your plugin.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**For multiple plugins**: Organize plugins in subdirectories like `./plugins/plugin-name` and update your marketplace.json accordingly. See [Plugin sources](/en/plugin-marketplaces#plugin-sources) for organization patterns.
</Note>

### Debug plugin issues

If your plugin isn't working as expected:

1. **Check the structure**: Ensure your directories are at the plugin root, not inside `.grok-plugin/`
2. **Test components individually**: Check each command, agent, and hook separately
3. **Use validation and debugging tools**: See [Debugging and development tools](/en/plugins-reference#debugging-and-development-tools) for CLI commands and troubleshooting techniques

### Share your plugins

When your plugin is ready to share:

1. **Add documentation**: Include a README.md with installation and usage instructions
2. **Version your plugin**: Use semantic versioning in your `plugin.json`
3. **Create or use a marketplace**: Distribute through plugin marketplaces for easy installation
4. **Test with others**: Have team members test the plugin before wider distribution

<Note>
For complete technical specifications, debugging techniques, and distribution strategies, see [Plugins reference](/en/plugins-reference).
</Note>

## Alternative Approaches (Current Implementation)

Since plugins are not yet implemented in Grok One-Shot, here are current alternatives:

### 1. Git-Based Configuration Sharing

Share configurations via Git repositories:

```bash
# Project structure for shared configs
my-grok-configs/
├── README.md
├── settings.json # Shared settings
├── mcp-servers/ # MCP server configs
│ └── filesystem.json
└── docs/
├── GROK.md # Shared project context
└── workflows.md # Team workflows
```

Team members clone and copy configurations:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/org/grok-configs
cp grok-configs/settings.json ~/.grok/settings.json
```

### 2. MCP Server Distribution

Grok One-Shot supports MCP servers, which can be packaged and shared:

```bash
# Add MCP server (current functionality)
grok mcp add filesystem "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
grok mcp add github "node github-mcp-server/dist/index.js"
```

Document MCP server setup in your project README:

```markdown
# Setup

## MCP Servers

Add these MCP servers for full functionality:

\`\`\`bash
grok mcp add filesystem "npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem"
grok mcp add custom-tools "node ./mcp-servers/custom/index.js"
\`\`\`
```

### 3. Shared Documentation

Use `.agent/docs/` for team-wide documentation:

```bash
# Project documentation structure
.agent/
├── docs/
│ ├── workflows/
│ │ ├── deployment.md
│ │ ├── testing.md
│ │ └── code-review.md
│ ├── standards/
│ │ ├── coding-style.md
│ │ └── security.md
│ └── setup/
│ ├── environment.md
│ └── tools.md
├── GROK.md # Main project context
└── docs-index.md # Documentation index
```

These docs are version-controlled and shared via Git.

### 4. Shell Scripts and Automation

Create reusable scripts in your repository:

```bash
# scripts/grok-helpers/
scripts/
├── format-code.sh # Code formatting helper
├── run-tests.sh # Test runner
├── check-security.sh # Security checks
└── README.md # Usage documentation
```

Reference these in your GROK.md:

```markdown
# Helper Scripts

This project includes helper scripts in `scripts/grok-helpers/`:

- `format-code.sh`: Format all code files
- `run-tests.sh`: Run full test suite
- `check-security.sh`: Security vulnerability scan

Ask me to run these when needed.
```

### 5. npm Packages for Shared Tools

Package shared tools as npm packages:

```json
// package.json
{
"name": "@org/grok-tools",
"version": "1.0.0",
"bin": {
"grok-format": "./bin/format.js",
"grok-test": "./bin/test.js"
}
}
```

Install across projects:

```bash
npm install -g @org/grok-tools
```

## When Plugins Are Implemented

Future plugin system in Grok One-Shot would likely include:

### Plugin Manifest (future):

```json
// .grok-plugin/plugin.json
{
"name": "my-plugin",
"version": "1.0.0",
"description": "Description of plugin functionality",
"author": {
"name": "Your Name",
"email": "you@example.com"
},
"dependencies": {
"other-plugin": "^2.0.0"
}
}
```

### Marketplace Configuration (future):

```json
// .grok-plugin/marketplace.json
{
"name": "org-marketplace",
"owner": {
"name": "Organization Name"
},
"plugins": [
{
"name": "my-plugin",
"source": "./my-plugin",
"description": "Plugin description"
}
]
}
```

### Usage Commands (future):

```bash
# Add marketplace
grok plugin marketplace add org/grok-plugins

# Install plugin
grok plugin install formatter@org

# List installed plugins
grok plugin list

# Update plugin
grok plugin update formatter@org

# Remove plugin
grok plugin uninstall formatter@org
```
