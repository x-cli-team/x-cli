---# Tool System

Built-in tools that enable AI to interact with your development environment.

## Overview

Grok One-Shot's power comes from its comprehensive tool system. Tools allow the AI to read files, execute commands, search code, and modify files - all the actions a developer needs.

## Core Tool Categories

### 1. File Operations

**Read Tool**
- **Purpose:** Read file contents
- **Usage:** AI reads code, configs, documentation
- **Example:**
```
> Explain how authentication works
[AI uses Read tool on src/auth/middleware.ts]
```

**Write Tool**
- **Purpose:** Create new files
- **Usage:** Generate new code, configs, docs
- **Confirmation:** Required (unless disabled)
- **Example:**
```
> Create a new authentication service
[AI uses Write tool to create src/services/auth-service.ts]
```

**Edit Tool**
- **Purpose:** Modify existing files
- **Usage:** Code changes, refactoring, fixes
- **Confirmation:** Required (unless disabled)
- **How it works:** Exact string replacement
- **Example:**
```
> Fix the error handling in user-service.ts
[AI uses Edit tool to modify specific lines]
```

### 2. Code Search

**Glob Tool**
- **Purpose:** Find files by pattern
- **Usage:** Locate files matching glob patterns
- **Fast:** Optimized file system search
- **Example:**
```
> Find all TypeScript test files
[AI uses Glob with pattern "**/*.test.ts"]
```

**Grep Tool**
- **Purpose:** Search file contents
- **Usage:** Find code patterns, function calls, imports
- **Powerful:** Full regex support via ripgrep
- **Example:**
```
> Find all TODO comments
[AI uses Grep with pattern "TODO"]
```

### 3. Command Execution

**Bash Tool**
- **Purpose:** Execute shell commands
- **Usage:** Run builds, tests, git operations
- **Confirmation:** Required (unless disabled)
- **Security:** Runs with your user permissions
- **Example:**
```
> Run the test suite
[AI uses Bash to execute "npm test"]
```

### 4. Advanced Tools

**Task Tool (Subagents)**
- **Purpose:** Spawn autonomous AI workers
- **Usage:** Complex multi-step tasks
- **When:** AI determines task needs deep exploration
- **Example:**
```
> Research the entire authentication flow and suggest improvements
[AI spawns Explore subagent to autonomously research]
```

**WebFetch Tool**
- **Purpose:** Fetch and analyze web pages
- **Usage:** Research documentation, check examples
- **Example:**
```
> Look up the latest Next.js routing docs
[AI uses WebFetch to fetch and analyze docs]
```

**WebSearch Tool**
- **Purpose:** Search the web
- **Usage:** Find current information, libraries, solutions
- **Example:**
```
> Find the most popular React state management libraries in 2025
[AI uses WebSearch to get current info]
```

## Tool Workflow

### Typical AI Tool Usage

**Example session:**
```
User: "Fix the bug in user authentication"

AI thinks: Need to find the auth code

1. Glob("src/**/*auth*.ts")
→ Finds: src/auth/middleware.ts, src/services/auth-service.ts

2. Read(src/auth/middleware.ts)
→ Loads file content

3. Read(src/services/auth-service.ts)
→ Loads related file

4. Analyze code, identify bug

5. Edit(src/auth/middleware.ts)
→ Fixes the bug

6. Responds: "Fixed authentication bug in line 47..."
```

## Tool Coordination

### Multi-Tool Operations

**AI coordinates multiple tools automatically:**

```
User: "Add unit tests for the payment processor"

AI workflow:
1. Glob → Find payment processor files
2. Read → Load implementation
3. Read → Load existing test patterns
4. Write → Create new test file
5. Bash → Run tests
6. Edit → Fix any failures
7. Bash → Run tests again
8. Respond → Summary of tests created
```

**Benefits:**
- Seamless multi-step operations
- Error recovery and iteration
- No manual intervention needed

### Tool Call Limits

**MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS protection:**
```bash
export MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS=400 # Default

# Prevents infinite loops
# Stops runaway tool usage
# Configurable per environment
```

**What happens at limit:**
```
AI: "I've reached the maximum number of tool calls (400).
Here's what I've completed so far..."
```

## Tool Capabilities

### Fully Implemented

**File operations:**
- Read files (any size with pagination)
- Write new files
- Edit existing files (exact string replacement)
- Glob search (fast pattern matching)
- Grep search (powerful regex via ripgrep)

**Command execution:**
- Run shell commands
- Capture stdout/stderr
- Handle timeouts
- Background execution
- Stream output

**Research:**
- Spawn subagents for exploration
- Web fetch with content analysis
- Web search integration

**Session management:**

- Architecture detection

**Plan mode:**
- Read-only exploration phase
- Plan generation and approval
- Plan-to-execution bridge

## Tool Configuration

### Confirmation System

**Control tool execution:**
```bash
# Enable confirmations (default)
grok toggle-confirmations
# Status: Confirmations enabled

# Disable for automation
grok toggle-confirmations
# Status: Confirmations disabled
```

**Per-tool behavior:**
- **Read, Glob, Grep:** No confirmation (read-only)
- **Write, Edit:** Confirmation required (unless disabled)
- **Bash:** Confirmation required (unless disabled)
- **Task:** No confirmation (spawns autonomous agent)

**Example with confirmations:**
```
AI: I'll edit src/auth/middleware.ts to fix the bug.

Approve this action? [y/n/v (view)]
y → Proceed
n → Cancel
v → View details before deciding
```

### Tool Timeouts

**Prevent hanging operations:**
```bash
# Bash tool timeout (default: 2 minutes)
# Can be extended for long operations
```

**Background execution:**
```typescript
// AI can run commands in background
Bash({
command: "npm run build",
run_in_background: true
});
// AI continues while build runs
```

### Tool Permissions

**Security model:**
- Tools run with **your user permissions**
- No privilege escalation
- Same access as running commands yourself

**File access:**
- Can access files you can access
- Respects file system permissions
- No special filesystem access

**Command execution:**
- Runs in your shell environment
- Has your PATH and environment variables
- Same capabilities as your terminal

## Best Practices

### Effective Tool Usage

**DO:**
- Let AI choose appropriate tools
- Trust AI's tool coordination
- Review confirmations before approving
- Monitor for unexpected tool usage

**DON'T:**
- Micro-manage tool selection
- Approve without reading (when confirmations enabled)
- Disable confirmations unless you trust the task
- Run with elevated privileges unnecessarily

### Error Handling

**AI handles tool errors:**
```
User: "Fix the bug in auth.ts"

AI:
1. Edit(auth.ts) → Error: File not found
2. Glob("**/*auth*.ts") → Find correct file
3. Read(src/auth/middleware.ts) → Success
4. Edit(src/auth/middleware.ts) → Success

Response: "Found the file at src/auth/middleware.ts and fixed the bug."
```

**Benefits:**
- Automatic error recovery
- Adapts to environment
- Continues despite failures

## Tool Examples

### Example 1: Code Search and Analysis

```
User: "Find all places where we connect to the database"

AI workflow:
1. Grep(pattern="database.*connect", output_mode="files_with_matches")
→ Results: 5 files

2. For each file:
Read(file)
→ Analyze connection code

3. Respond:
"Database connections found in:
- src/db/connection.ts (main connection pool)
- src/services/user-service.ts (direct query)
- tests/integration/db-test.ts (test connection)
- scripts/migrate.ts (migration connection)
- scripts/seed.ts (seeding connection)

Recommendation: Consolidate to use connection pool from connection.ts"
```

### Example 2: Multi-File Refactoring

```
User: "Rename getUserById to findUserById across the codebase"

AI workflow:
1. Grep(pattern="getUserById")
→ Found in 8 files

2. For each file:
Read(file)
Edit(file, old_string="getUserById", new_string="findUserById")

3. Grep(pattern="getUserById")
→ Verify no remaining occurrences

4. Respond:
"Renamed getUserById to findUserById in 8 files:
- src/services/user-service.ts (definition)
- src/api/user-routes.ts (3 usages)
- src/middleware/auth.ts (1 usage)
- tests/user-service.test.ts (12 usages)
- ... (4 more files)

All references updated successfully."
```

### Example 3: Research and Implementation

```
User: "Research how to implement rate limiting and add it to our API"

AI workflow:
1. Task(subagent_type="general-purpose")
→ Spawns research agent

Subagent:
- WebSearch("API rate limiting best practices 2025")
- WebFetch("https://example.com/rate-limiting-guide")
- Analyzes approaches
- Returns recommendation

2. Main agent receives research
3. Read(src/api/server.ts)
4. Write(src/middleware/rate-limiter.ts)
→ New rate limiting middleware

5. Edit(src/api/server.ts)
→ Integrate middleware

6. Write(tests/rate-limiter.test.ts)
→ Add tests

7. Bash("npm test")
→ Verify tests pass

8. Respond:
"Implemented rate limiting middleware using token bucket algorithm.
- 100 requests per minute per IP
- Configurable limits via environment
- Tests passing
- Ready to deploy"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Tool Failures

**Symptoms:** AI says "Tool call failed"

**Common causes:**
- File doesn't exist (Read/Edit)
- Permission denied (Write/Edit/Bash)
- Syntax error (Edit with invalid old_string)
- Timeout (Bash for long operations)

**AI recovery:**
- Tries alternative approach
- Reports error to user
- Suggests manual action if necessary

### Unexpected Behavior

**Symptoms:** AI uses tools unexpectedly

**Possible causes:**
- Ambiguous prompt
- AI misunderstood intent
- Overly broad request

**Solutions:**
```
Be more specific
Use confirmations to catch unexpected actions
Review AI's plan before execution
```

### Rate Limiting

**Symptoms:** "Too many tool rounds"

**Cause:** Hit MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS limit

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Increase limit
export MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS=500

# Or break task into smaller pieces
```
