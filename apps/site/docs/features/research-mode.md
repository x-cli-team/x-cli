# Research Mode

Deep codebase exploration and analysis capabilities.

## Overview

Research mode enables Grok One-Shot to autonomously explore codebases, analyze architectures, and provide comprehensive insights. It leverages subagents for deep, systematic investigation.

## What is Research Mode?

### Automatic Activation

**AI determines when research is needed:**
```
User: "How does the authentication system work across the entire application?"

AI thinks: This requires exploring multiple files and tracing flows.
→ Activates research via Explore subagent
```

**Indicators that trigger research mode:**
- Questions about "overall architecture"
- Requests to "find all occurrences" of something
- "How does X work?" when X spans multiple files
- "Analyze the system" type requests
- Complex codebase queries

### vs. Simple Queries

**Simple query (no subagent needed):**
```
User: "Read src/auth/middleware.ts and explain it"

AI:
1. Read file
2. Analyze
3. Respond
```

**Complex research (subagent activated):**
```
User: "Analyze the entire authentication flow from login to session management"

AI:
1. Spawns Explore subagent
2. Subagent autonomously:
- Searches for auth-related files
- Reads relevant code
- Traces execution flows
- Identifies patterns
- Documents findings
3. Returns comprehensive analysis
```

## Research Workflows

### Example 1: Architecture Analysis

**User request:**
```
> Explain the overall architecture of this application
```

**AI workflow:**
```
1. Spawns Explore subagent
2. Subagent explores:
- Project structure (tree view)
- Package.json dependencies
- Entry points (index.ts, server.ts)
- Core modules and services
- Configuration files
- Documentation

3. Analyzes patterns:
- Module organization
- Architectural style (MVC, microservices, etc.)
- Communication patterns
- Data flow

4. Generates overview
```

**Output example:**
```
Architecture Overview:

1. Structure: Layered architecture with separation of concerns
- Presentation: src/ui/ (React/Ink components)
- Business Logic: src/services/
- Data Access: src/agent/
- Utilities: src/utils/

2. Key Components:
- GrokAgent: Core AI agent with streaming support
- Chat Interface: Terminal UI using React/Ink
- MCP Integration: Extensibility via Model Context Protocol
- Tool System: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob, Grep tools

3. Communication:
- UI ← EventEmitter → Agent
- Agent ← HTTPS → X.AI API
- Agent ← stdin/stdout → MCP Servers

4. State Management:
- Session state in ~/.grok/sessions/
- Configuration in ~/.grok/settings.json
- No persistent database

5. Dependencies:
- Main: @anthropic-ai/sdk, ink, react
- Build: typescript, tsup, bun
- Testing: (to be added)
```

### Example 2: Feature Investigation

**User request:**
```
> How does the authentication middleware work? Trace the entire flow.
```

**AI workflow:**
```
1. Spawns Explore subagent
2. Subagent investigates:
- Find auth middleware: Glob("**/*auth*middleware*")
- Read middleware file
- Find usages: Grep("import.*auth.*middleware")
- Trace dependencies
- Identify authentication logic

3. Builds flow diagram
4. Documents findings
```

**Output example:**
```
Authentication Flow:

1. Request Entry:
src/api/server.ts:45
app.use('/api', authMiddleware, apiRoutes)

2. Middleware Execution:
src/middleware/auth-middleware.ts:23
- Extract token from Authorization header
- Verify token using JWT library
- Check token expiration
- Attach user to request: req.user = decoded

3. Error Handling:
- Missing token → 401 Unauthorized
- Invalid token → 401 Unauthorized
- Expired token → 401 Unauthorized
- Valid token → Continue to route handler

4. Route Handler:
src/api/user-routes.ts:67
- Access authenticated user: req.user
- Perform authorized action
- Return response

Dependencies:
- jsonwebtoken: Token verification
- bcrypt: Password hashing (in auth service)

Security Considerations:
Token expiration checked
HTTPS enforced
No refresh token mechanism
No rate limiting on auth endpoints
```

### Example 3: Dependency Analysis

**User request:**
```
> Find all places that depend on the user service and analyze potential impact of changes
```

**AI workflow:**
```
1. Spawns Explore subagent
2. Subagent searches:
- Find user service: Glob("**/user-service*")
- Find imports: Grep("import.*user.*service")
- Read dependent files
- Analyze usage patterns

3. Impact analysis:
- Direct dependencies
- Transitive dependencies
- Potential breaking changes
```

**Output example:**
```
User Service Dependencies:

Direct Dependencies (7 files):
1. src/api/user-routes.ts
- Uses: getUserById, createUser, updateUser
- Impact: High (API endpoints)

2. src/middleware/auth-middleware.ts
- Uses: getUserById
- Impact: Critical (authentication)

3. src/services/order-service.ts
- Uses: getUserById
- Impact: Medium (order processing)

[... 4 more files]

Transitive Dependencies (12 files):
- Files that depend on the above 7 files
- Lower impact, changes may propagate

Recommended Changes:
1. If modifying getUserById signature:
→ Update 5 direct call sites
→ Test authentication flow
→ Test order processing

2. If deprecating methods:
→ Provide migration path
→ Update 7 dependent files

3. Mitigation:
→ Add integration tests
→ Use TypeScript for type safety
→ Document breaking changes
```

### Example 4: Security Audit

**User request:**
```
> Perform a security audit of the codebase
```

**AI workflow:**
```
1. Spawns Explore subagent (or general-purpose)
2. Subagent analyzes:
- Authentication/authorization
- Input validation
- SQL injection risks
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Secrets management
- Dependency vulnerabilities

3. Generates security report
```

**Output example:**
```
Security Audit Report:

High Priority Issues:
SQL Injection Risk
- File: src/services/user-service.ts:142
- Issue: String concatenation in SQL query
- Recommendation: Use parameterized queries

Missing Input Validation
- File: src/api/user-routes.ts:89
- Issue: User input not validated
- Recommendation: Add validation middleware

Medium Priority:
No Rate Limiting
- Endpoints vulnerable to brute force
- Recommendation: Add rate limiting middleware

Secrets in Environment Variables
- API keys in .env file (not gitignored)
- Recommendation: Use secrets manager

Low Priority:
Outdated Dependencies
- 3 dependencies with known CVEs
- Recommendation: Update dependencies

Good Practices Found:
HTTPS enforced
Password hashing with bcrypt
JWT token expiration
CORS configured

Action Items:
1. Fix SQL injection (High)
2. Add input validation (High)
3. Implement rate limiting (Medium)
4. Migrate secrets management (Medium)
5. Update dependencies (Low)
```

## Research Best Practices

### Effective Research Prompts

**DO:**
```
"Analyze the entire authentication system and document the flow"
"Find all database queries and check for SQL injection risks"
"Explain the architecture of the payment processing module"
"Trace how user data flows from API to database"
```

**DON'T:**
```
"Look at everything"
"Check the code"
"Find stuff"
```

### Managing Research Scope

**Focused research:**
```
> Analyze authentication in src/auth/ directory only

[Limits scope, faster results]
```

**Broad research:**
```
> Analyze how authentication integrates across the entire application

[Wider scope, more comprehensive, takes longer]
```

### Iterative Research

**Progressive refinement:**
```
Step 1: "Give me an overview of the authentication system"
[AI provides high-level summary]

Step 2: "Explain the token verification process in detail"
[AI deep-dives into specific component]

Step 3: "Are there security issues in the token verification?"
[AI focuses on security analysis]
```

**Benefits:**
- Build understanding progressively
- Control depth of analysis
- Manage context usage

## Research Limitations

### Current Limitations

**No plan mode yet:**
- Research executes immediately
- No read-only exploration phase
- No plan approval step

**Limited visualization:**
- Text-only output
- No diagrams or graphs
- No interactive exploration

**Manual dependency tracking:**
- AI manually follows imports
- No automatic dependency graph
- No impact analysis tool

**Context limits:**
- Large codebases may hit token limits
- Deep exploration accumulates context
- May need multiple sessions

### Workarounds

**For large codebases:**
```
# Break into multiple research sessions
Session 1: "Analyze frontend architecture"
Session 2: "Analyze backend architecture"
Session 3: "Analyze database layer"
```

**For deep exploration:**
```
# Use headless mode for specific queries
grok -p "list all authentication-related files"
grok -p "analyze src/auth/middleware.ts specifically"
```

## Advanced Research Techniques

### Research with Web Access

**Leverage WebFetch and WebSearch:**
```
> Research best practices for implementing OAuth 2.0 and check if our implementation follows them

AI:
1. WebSearch("OAuth 2.0 best practices 2025")
2. WebFetch(relevant documentation URLs)
3. Analyze codebase implementation
4. Compare against best practices
5. Provide recommendations
```

### Multi-Phase Research

**Complex investigations:**
```
Phase 1: Discovery
> What are all the API endpoints and their authentication requirements?

Phase 2: Analysis
> For each endpoint, analyze the security implementation

Phase 3: Recommendations
> Suggest improvements based on industry best practices
```

### Research Documentation

**Generate research reports:**
```
> Research the payment processing system and create a comprehensive markdown report

AI generates:
- Architecture overview
- Component diagram (textual)
- Data flow description
- Security analysis
- Recommendations
- Action items

Saved as: docs/research/payment-system-analysis.md
```

## Troubleshooting Research

### Research Takes Too Long

**Causes:**
- Scope too broad
- Too many files to analyze
- Deep nested dependencies

**Solutions:**
```
# Limit scope
> Analyze authentication in src/auth/ only (not entire codebase)

# Or use faster model
GROK_MODEL=grok-4-fast-non-reasoning grok

# Or break into smaller queries
```

### Incomplete Research

**Causes:**
- Hit token limit
- Hit tool round limit
- Network timeout

**Solutions:**
```
# Increase limits
export MAX_TOOL_ROUNDS=500

# Or continue research
> Continue analysis from where you stopped

# Or break into phases
```

### Context Overload

**Symptoms:** Research session grows to 80k+ tokens

**Solution:**
```
# Start new session with summary
> Summarize findings so far
[Copy summary]

/exit
grok

> Continuing from previous research:
[Paste summary]
Now analyze [next phase]
```
