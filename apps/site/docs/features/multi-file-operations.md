title: Advanced Multi-File Operations
---# Advanced Multi-File Operations

**Status:** Planned Feature (TBD)

## Overview

Advanced multi-file operations will enable coordinated, atomic changes across multiple files with automatic dependency tracking, impact analysis, and rollback capabilities.

## Planned Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Atomic transactions** - All changes succeed or all roll back
- **Change tracking** - Track relationships between file modifications
- **Impact analysis** - Predict effects of changes across codebase
- **Dependency detection** - Automatic dependency graph generation
- **Safe refactoring** - Rename, extract, inline across files
- **Preview mode** - See all changes before applying
- **Staged rollback** - Undo multi-file operations atomically

### Refactoring Operations

- **Rename symbol** - Safely rename across all files
- **Extract function/class** - Move code to new file
- **Inline function/class** - Merge code from file
- **Move declaration** - Relocate code between files
- **Change signature** - Update function signature everywhere
- **Extract interface** - Create interface from implementation

### Architecture-Aware Changes

- **Pattern-based refactoring** - Apply changes following project patterns
- **Consistent styling** - Maintain code style across modifications
- **Import management** - Automatic import updates
- **Type propagation** - Update types across affected files

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Rename getUserById to findUserById across the entire codebase"

[Multi-File Operation Initiated]

AI Analysis:
- Found 23 occurrences across 8 files
- Dependency graph generated
- Impact: 8 files directly, 12 files indirectly affected

Preview:
src/services/user-service.ts (definition)
- Line 47: getUserById → findUserById

src/api/user-routes.ts (3 usages)
- Line 23, 45, 67: getUserById → findUserById

[6 more files with line-by-line preview]

Risk: Low (rename operation, no signature change)

[Approve All] [Preview Diffs] [Cancel]

User: Approve All

[Atomic transaction executed]
All 8 files updated successfully
Tests pass
Imports updated automatically
```

## Roadmap

### Q1 2025: Sprint 6-8 (6 weeks)
- Change impact analysis
- Dependency tracking
- Coordinated multi-file editing
- Safe refactoring (rename, extract, inline)
- Atomic transactions with rollback
- Pattern-based changes

**Priority:** P0 - Critical for competitive viability

## Current Capabilities

**Available now:**
- Sequential file edits
- Manual coordination
- AI tracks changes

**Limitations:**
- No atomic transactions
- No automatic rollback
- Manual dependency tracking
