# X-CLI Roadmap

This roadmap is automatically generated from our internal task tracking system.

## Sprint: Advanced Tooling Efficiency - Caching & Model-Aware Selection

Build on the 61% token reduction from the previous sprint by implementing advanced caching mechanisms and model-aware tool selection. Focus on cross-session state persistence, LLM-guided intent prediction, and parallel tool execution to achieve an additional 20-30% efficiency gains.

## Sprint: Tooling Architecture Performance Optimization

Implement a comprehensive optimization of the x-cli tooling architecture to address the high token overhead identified in the 2025-10-31 Token Usage Investigation. Focus on reducing baseline tool schema costs (2,000-3,000 tokens per request), eliminating unbounded conversation growth, and implementing efficient context management.
