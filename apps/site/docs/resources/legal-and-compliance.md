# Legal and compliance

> Legal agreements, compliance information, and security details for Grok One-Shot.

## Legal agreements

### License

Grok One-Shot is open-source software licensed under the MIT License.

Your use of Grok One-Shot is subject to:
- **Grok One-Shot**: MIT License (see repository LICENSE file)
- **xAI Grok API**: [xAI Terms of Service](https://x.ai/legal/terms-of-service)

> **Parity Gap**: Unlike Claude Code which has formal Commercial Terms (Team, Enterprise, API) and Consumer Terms (Free, Pro, Max), Grok One-Shot is a third-party open-source CLI tool governed by:
> 1. MIT License for the CLI tool itself
> 2. xAI's API terms for API usage

### Commercial agreements

**Claude Code approach**:
- Commercial Terms apply to Team, Enterprise, and Claude API users
- Consumer Terms apply to Free, Pro, and Max users
- Whether using 1P (Anthropic) or 3P (Bedrock/Vertex), existing commercial agreements apply

**Grok One-Shot approach**:
- MIT License for CLI tool (permissive, commercial-friendly)
- xAI API terms apply uniformly to all API users
- No first-party vs third-party distinction (xAI API only)
- No tiered commercial agreements within Grok One-Shot

When using Grok One-Shot, you are making API calls to xAI using your own API key. Your usage is governed by:
- [xAI API Terms of Service](https://x.ai/legal/terms-of-service)
- [xAI Privacy Policy](https://x.ai/legal/privacy-policy)
- Any commercial agreements you have with xAI (if applicable)

## Compliance

### Healthcare compliance (BAA)

**Claude Code**:
- BAA available for customers with Zero Data Retention (ZDR)
- Automatically extends to Claude Code usage
- Applicable to Team/Enterprise with BAA + ZDR

**Grok One-Shot**:
- xAI does not currently offer Business Associate Agreements (BAA) for HIPAA compliance
- No Zero Data Retention (ZDR) option
- Not suitable for PHI without explicit xAI agreement

> **Parity Gap**: Critical compliance gap for healthcare use cases.

**If you require HIPAA compliance**:
1. Contact xAI directly about enterprise agreements
2. Verify if BAA and ZDR options are available
3. Do not process PHI through Grok One-Shot without proper legal agreements
4. Consider alternative solutions with BAA support (like Claude Code)

### Enterprise compliance certifications

> **Parity Gap**: Grok One-Shot does not have formal enterprise compliance certifications. For enterprise use cases requiring SOC 2, ISO 27001, or other certifications, review xAI's compliance status directly.

**Claude Code certifications**:
- SOC 2 Type II (via Anthropic Trust Center)
- Various compliance artifacts available
- Trust Center: [trust.anthropic.com](https://trust.anthropic.com)

**Grok One-Shot status**:
- Open-source project (no formal certifications for CLI)
- xAI API compliance varies
- Recommend reviewing xAI's compliance documentation

**Recommendations for enterprise use**:
1. Review xAI's security and compliance documentation
2. Conduct your own security assessment of Grok One-Shot codebase
3. Implement network controls (API proxies, logging) if needed
4. Use internal forks if additional controls are required
5. Keep Grok One-Shot updated to latest version

## Security and trust

### Trust and safety

**Claude Code**:
- [Anthropic Trust Center](https://trust.anthropic.com)
- [Transparency Hub](https://www.anthropic.com/transparency)
- Comprehensive compliance artifacts
- SOC 2 Type II reports

**Grok One-Shot**:
- Open-source codebase (full transparency)
- No centralized trust center
- xAI security documentation: [x.ai/legal/security](https://x.ai/legal/security)
- Community security reviews via GitHub

> **Parity Gap**: No formal trust center or compliance artifact repository. Open-source transparency provides different security model.

### Security vulnerability reporting

**Claude Code**:
- Managed through HackerOne
- Formal bug bounty program
- Coordinated disclosure process
- [Report vulnerabilities](https://hackerone.com/anthropic-vdp/reports/new?type=team&report_type=vulnerability)

**Grok One-Shot**:
- Report via GitHub Security Advisories
- Or email maintainers (see repository)
- Community-driven coordinated disclosure
- No formal bug bounty program

**For xAI/Grok API vulnerabilities**:
- Report to xAI's security team
- Follow xAI's responsible disclosure policy

### Open-source security benefits

**Transparency advantages**:
- Full source code available on GitHub
- No obfuscation or hidden functionality
- Community review and contributions welcome
- Dependencies auditable via `package.json`

**Security features**:
- API key stored locally (not transmitted except to xAI)
- No third-party telemetry or tracking
- Local-only execution (no cloud components)
- TLS encryption for API communication
- No external dependencies for core functionality

**Security considerations**:
- Session files contain full conversation history (stored locally)
- API key stored in plaintext in `~/.x-cli/settings.json` (use `chmod 600`)
- File system access as broad as your user permissions
- Bash command execution capabilities (by design)

## Data handling

### Data policies comparison

| Aspect | Claude Code | Grok One-Shot |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Training opt-out** | Consumer control | API-level only |
| **Commercial no-train** | Default | Per xAI policy |
| **Development Partner Program** | Opt-in | Not available |
| **Data retention tiers** | 5yr/30d/ZDR | Per xAI policy |
| **Local session storage** | Configurable | Manual cleanup |
| **Telemetry** | Opt-out available | Not implemented |

### What Grok One-Shot accesses

By design, Grok One-Shot can:
- Read any file your user account can read
- Write/edit any file your user account can write
- Execute bash commands with your user privileges
- Send file contents and code to xAI API as context

**Security best practices**:
1. Run Grok One-Shot with appropriate user permissions (not root)
2. Use `.grokignore` or `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
3. Review prompts before confirming operations
4. Keep API keys secure and rotated regularly
5. Monitor `~/.x-cli/sessions/` for sensitive data

### What gets sent to xAI

When using Grok One-Shot, the following data is sent to xAI's API:
- Your prompts and messages
- Code and file contents you reference
- Tool execution results (file contents, command outputs)
- Conversation history for context

**Data minimization tips**:
1. Be selective about which files you ask Grok One-Shot to read
2. Avoid including credentials or secrets in prompts
3. Use environment variables instead of hardcoded secrets
4. Review session files before sharing for bug reports

## Compliance certifications

> **Parity Gap**: Grok One-Shot is an open-source community project without formal compliance certifications. For regulated industries, conduct your own assessment.

### Currently unavailable

**Formal certifications**:
- SOC 2 Type II certification
- ISO 27001 certification
- HIPAA BAA
- FedRAMP authorization
- GDPR Data Processing Agreement (DPA)
- PCI-DSS certification

**Why these are unavailable**:
- Grok One-Shot is an open-source CLI tool, not a SaaS service
- Certifications apply to xAI's API infrastructure
- Users should review xAI's compliance directly

### For compliance needs

**Steps for regulated industries**:
1. Review xAI's compliance status for the API layer
2. Conduct your own risk assessment of Grok One-Shot
3. Implement additional controls as needed:
- API proxies for logging and monitoring
- Network-level security controls
- Audit trails and access controls
4. Consider forking and adding required controls
5. Consult with your compliance team before production use

### GDPR (Europe)

**User rights**:
- **Right to access**: View your local session files in `~/.x-cli/`
- **Right to deletion**: Delete `~/.x-cli/` directory; contact xAI for API data
- **Right to portability**: Session files are JSON (portable format)
- **Right to object**: Stop using the service at any time

**Data controller roles**:
- **Local data**: You (the user)
- **API data**: xAI (data processor)

### CCPA (California)

**Consumer rights**:
- Right to know what data is collected
- Right to deletion
- Right to opt-out of "sales" (not applicable - no data sales)
- Right to non-discrimination

**Compliance**:
- Grok One-Shot does not "sell" data
- Local data under your control
- API data governed by xAI's CCPA compliance

### HIPAA (Healthcare)

** Critical warning**:
- **Do NOT use Grok One-Shot with PHI (Protected Health Information)** without ensuring xAI has appropriate BAA
- Default configuration is **NOT HIPAA-compliant**
- Consult legal counsel before using with healthcare data

### PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry)

** Important**:
- **Do NOT use Grok One-Shot with payment card data (PAN, CVV, etc.)**
- Not designed for PCI-DSS compliance
- Use specialized PCI-compliant tools instead
