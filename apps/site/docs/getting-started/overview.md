# Grok One-Shot Overview

> Learn about Grok One-Shot, an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal and helps you turn ideas into code faster than ever before.

## Get started in 30 seconds

Prerequisites:

* A Grok API key from [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai)

**Install Grok One-Shot:**

```bash
# Using npm (Node.js 18+)
npm install -g @xagent/one-shot

# Using Bun (faster)
bun install -g @xagent/one-shot
```

**Start using Grok One-Shot:**

```bash
# Set your API key
export GROK_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Navigate to your project
cd your-project

# Start Grok One-Shot
grok
```

You'll see the welcome screen on first use. That's it! [Continue with Quickstart (5 mins) →](./quickstart.md)

> ** Parity Gap:** Grok One-Shot does not yet have a native installer script like Claude Code's `curl | bash` method. Installation currently requires npm or Bun. See [Troubleshooting](../build-with-claude-code/troubleshooting.md) if you hit issues.

> ** Parity Gap:** Grok One-Shot does not yet have a VS Code extension. All interactions are terminal-based.

## What Grok One-Shot does for you

* **Build features from descriptions**: Tell Grok One-Shot what you want to build in plain English. It will make a plan, write the code, and ensure it works.
* **Debug and fix issues**: Describe a bug or paste an error message. Grok One-Shot will analyze your codebase, identify the problem, and implement a fix.
* **Navigate any codebase**: Ask anything about your codebase, and get a thoughtful answer back. Grok One-Shot maintains awareness of your entire project structure and can find up-to-date information from the web with [MCP](../build-with-claude-code/mcp.md) integration for external datasources.
* **Automate tedious tasks**: Fix lint issues, resolve merge conflicts, and write release notes. Do all this in a single command from your developer machines, or automatically in CI.

## Why developers love Grok One-Shot

* **Works in your terminal**: Not another chat window. Not another IDE. Grok One-Shot meets you where you already work, with the tools you already love.
* **Takes action**: Grok One-Shot can directly edit files, run commands, and create commits. Need more? [MCP](../build-with-claude-code/mcp.md) lets Grok One-Shot read your design docs in Google Drive, update your tickets in Jira, or use *your* custom developer tooling.
* **Unix philosophy**: Grok One-Shot is composable and scriptable. `tail -f app.log | grok -p "Notify me if you see any anomalies in this log stream"` *works*. Your CI can run `grok -p "If there are new text strings, translate them into French and raise a PR for review"`.
* **Fast and efficient**: Powered by Grok's fast reasoning models from xAI, with efficient token usage and quick response times.

> ** Parity Gap:** Grok One-Shot uses the Grok API (xAI) instead of Claude API. No enterprise hosting options (AWS Bedrock, GCP Vertex AI) are currently available. Security and compliance features are limited compared to Claude Code Enterprise.

## Architecture

Grok One-Shot is built with TypeScript and runs on Node.js or Bun:

```
User Terminal
│
▼
Grok One-Shot (React/Ink UI)
│
├─→ Chat Interface
├─→ Confirmation System
└─→ Input Handling
│
▼
GrokAgent (Core Logic)
│
├─→ Message Management
├─→ Tool Execution (Read, Write, Edit, Bash, etc.)
└─→ Context Loading
│
▼
Grok API (xAI)
grok-2-1212 / grok-beta
```

## System Requirements

**Minimum:**
- Node.js 18+ or Bun runtime
- Terminal with 256-color support
- Grok API key from [console.x.ai](https://console.x.ai)
- 100MB disk space

**Recommended:**
- Bun runtime (4x faster than Node.js)
- Modern terminal (iTerm2, Windows Terminal, Alacritty, etc.)
- Git installed for repository operations
- 200MB disk space for session storage

## Getting Help
