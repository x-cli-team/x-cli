- **Tool Integration**: Seamless integration with development tools
- **User Experience**: Intuitive and efficient interaction patterns

This CLI aims to bring the power of Claude Code to terminal-based workflows while maintaining the flexibility and extensibility that makes it unique.

## üìö Documentation System Workflow

### Before Planning Features:

1. **Read `.agent/README.md`** for project overview
2. **Check `.agent/system/`** for architecture context
3. **Review `.agent/tasks/`** for related work
4. **Scan `.agent/sop/`** for established patterns

### During Implementation:

- Store PRDs in `.agent/tasks/` before coding
- Reference architecture docs for consistency
- Follow established patterns from SOPs
- Use cross-references between .agent docs

### After Implementation:

- **ALWAYS use smart push**: `git pushup` or `npm run smart-push` (never `git push origin main`)
- Run `/update-agent-docs` to capture changes
- Update `.agent/system/` if architecture changed
- Add new SOPs for repeatable processes
- Link related tasks and documents

### Documentation Rules:

- Keep system docs as single source of truth
- Use relative links between .agent documents
- Maintain concise, actionable content
- Update cross-references when adding new docs

### Token Optimization:

- Read .agent docs hierarchically (README ‚Üí critical-state ‚Üí relevant docs)
- Expect ~600 tokens for full context vs 3000+ without system
- Use .agent structure to avoid redundant codebase scanning
- Reference existing documentation rather than recreating context
