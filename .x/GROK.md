Always check the `.agent` folder first, as it is key to our workflow for keeping documentation updated, avoiding waste and rework, and learning from our errors.

## ðŸŽ¯ Strategic Development Priority

**PRIMARY FOCUS**: Competitive parity analysis drives all sprint planning. Refer to [`.agent/parity/`](./.agent/parity/) for comprehensive competitive analysis against Claude Code, Cursor IDE, and OpenAI Codex.

### Critical Development Gaps (P0)
- **Plan Mode Implementation** - Claude Code's signature read-only exploration capability
- **Deep Codebase Understanding** - Million-line codebase analysis and instant search
- **Multi-File Intelligence** - Coordinated edits with dependency awareness
- **Autonomous Task Execution** - End-to-end task completion without supervision

### Sprint Planning Reference
All new sprints must reference the [gap analysis](./.agent/parity/gap-analysis.md) and follow the [implementation roadmap](./.agent/parity/implementation-roadmap.md) to ensure strategic alignment with competitive positioning goals.

**Current Competitive Score**: 65/100 (vs Claude Code 95/100)  
**Target**: 90%+ feature parity by Q4 2025
